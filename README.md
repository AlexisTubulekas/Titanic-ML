# Titanic-ML

The Titanic Machine Learning Challenge is one of Kaggle's competitions. The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. The data set includes passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. By training a model based on a given data set that also contains information whether the passanger survived the task is to predict whether the other 418 passengers on board in the test data set survived.

By cleaning the data, performing feature engineering and applying a Random Forest Classifier I managed to successfully predic the outcome of 79.904% of the passengers in the test set.
